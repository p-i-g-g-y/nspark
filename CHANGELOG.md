# Changelog

All notable changes to **NSpark** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The public API contract is enforced by `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` files in the
source tree; any change to that file is, by definition, a breaking change and
will be reflected here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-alpha.2] - 2026-05-26

### Docs
- Full rewrite of `docs/signer.md` for the new async `ISparkSigner` surface:
  contract listing, per-member implementation guide, encrypted-batch design
  notes, async `RemoteSparkSigner` reference, pointers to the public
  `SparkTxBuilder` + `FrostAggregator` helpers.
- Strengthened `docs/trust-model.md` "host process compromise" row to
  reflect the encrypted-batch boundary — HSM-backed signers now have zero
  plaintext private material in the wallet process.
- `docs/architecture.md` diagram + FROST-signing section updated to
  `CreateWalletAsync` and the new signer-boundary invariants.
- `README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/faq.md`,
  `docs/lightning/receiving-invoices.md`, `docs/lightning/description-hash.md`:
  every quick-start example uses `await spark.CreateWalletAsync(...)`.
- No code changes — published to refresh the README bundled into the
  NuGet package.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-05-26

### Breaking — full remote-signing refactor

`ISparkSigner` is now fully async and proto-aware. Every cryptographic operation
that touches private key material — ECDSA over the identity key, ECIES
decryption, per-leaf FROST signing, tweak-share computation, deterministic
Lightning preimages, static-deposit key access, swap-adaptor key generation —
flows through this interface. Custom signer implementations targeting HSMs,
KMS-backed services, or hardware wallets now only need to fulfil one contract;
the rest of NSpark stays the same.

No plaintext share material, no intermediate-key plaintext, and no tweak
signature payload ever crosses the wallet's address space. The signer builds
and ECIES-encrypts the per-SO `SendLeafKeyTweaks` / `ClaimLeafKeyTweaks` /
`SecretShare` proto packages internally and returns only the encrypted blobs
the wallet plugs into the gRPC request.

### Added
- `NSpark.Signer.FrostAggregator` — public, pure-public-key FROST signature
  aggregation. Combines the user's partial signature with SO partial signatures
  into the final aggregated FROST signature. Safe to call from any custom
  signer implementation.
- `NSpark.Services.SparkTxBuilder` — public Spark-protocol Bitcoin transaction
  construction (`BuildRefundTxTrio`, `BuildHtlcTransaction`, `BuildNodeTxPair`,
  `ComputeMultiInputSighash`). No private key material crosses this boundary.
- `NSpark.Services.SparkBitcoinTx`, `SparkRefundTxTrio`, `SparkNodeTxPair` —
  public records returned by `SparkTxBuilder`.
- `NSpark.Signer` DTOs for the new signer surface: `SoTarget`,
  `SendTweakLeafDescriptor`, `ClaimTweakLeafDescriptor`,
  `EncryptedSendTweakBatch`, `EncryptedClaimTweakBatch`,
  `EncryptedPreimageShareBundle`, `LeafFrostSignature`,
  `LeafFrostNonceCommitment`, `SigningCommitment`, `AdaptorKeyHandle`.

### Changed
- **`SparkConnection.CreateWallet*` is now async** —
  `CreateWalletAsync(string mnemonic, ...)` and
  `CreateWalletAsync(ISparkSigner signer, ...)`. One round-trip to the signer
  at construction time caches the identity + deposit public keys so
  `wallet.IdentityPublicKey`, `IdentityPublicKeyHex`, `GetSparkAddress()`,
  `DepositPublicKey` remain synchronous accessors.
- **`ISparkSigner` is fully async** — every member returns `Task` /
  `Task<TResult>` and takes `CancellationToken`. New surface:
  `GetIdentityPublicKeyAsync`, `GetDepositPublicKeyAsync`,
  `GetLeafPublicKeyAsync`, `GetStaticDepositPublicKeyAsync`,
  `SignWithIdentityKeyAsync`, `SignCompactWithIdentityKeyAsync`,
  `DecryptEciesWithIdentityKeyAsync`, `SignLeafFrostAsync`,
  `GenerateLeafFrostNonceAsync` + `SignLeafFrostWithNonceAsync` (two-phase),
  `BuildEncryptedSendTweaksAsync`, `BuildEncryptedClaimTweaksAsync`,
  `BuildEncryptedPreimageSharesAsync`,
  `GenerateStaticDepositFrostNonceAsync` +
  `SignStaticDepositFrostWithNonceAsync` (two-phase),
  `ExportStaticDepositPrivateKeyAsync`, `GenerateAdaptorKeyAsync`.
- `SparkWallet` caches identity + deposit pubkeys; new `wallet.IdentityPublicKey`
  and `wallet.DepositPublicKey` byte-array accessors replace the synchronous
  `wallet.Signer.IdentityPublicKey` path.
- `SparkAuthenticator` and `SspAuthenticator` are fully async against the signer.
- Lightning invoice preimage generation is now deterministic via the signer
  (`HMAC-SHA256(htlcPreimageKey, transferId)`), matching the existing
  `docs/signer.md` contract. The preimage never crosses the wallet boundary
  — only the public payment hash + per-SO encrypted shares do.
- `TokenService` callers go through `SignWithIdentityKeyAsync`.

### Removed
- `ISparkSigner.IdentityPublicKey` (sync getter) — use
  `wallet.IdentityPublicKey` or `await signer.GetIdentityPublicKeyAsync()`.
- `ISparkSigner.IdentityPrivateKey` — replaced by
  `DecryptEciesWithIdentityKeyAsync` (the only legitimate consumer).
  Remote signers no longer need to expose the raw scalar.
- `ISparkSigner.DepositPublicKey` (sync getter) — use
  `wallet.DepositPublicKey` or `await signer.GetDepositPublicKeyAsync()`.
- `ISparkSigner.DeriveLeafSigningKey` / `DeriveStaticDepositKey` — replaced
  by the encrypted-batch builders and explicit `ExportStaticDepositPrivateKeyAsync`
  (used only in `ClaimStaticDepositAsync`, where the protocol requires
  revealing the key to the SSP).
- `ISparkSigner.FrostSign` / `GenerateFrostCommitments` / `GeneratePreimage`
  (old sync stubs) — superseded by the new async surface.
- `SparkConnection.CreateWallet` (sync) — replaced by `CreateWalletAsync`.

### Security
- The wallet's address space no longer contains any raw VSS share material,
  intermediate signing keys, ECIES-decrypted scalars, or random preimages.
  Every operation that produces sensitive material does so inside the signer's
  trust boundary and ECIES-encrypts before returning to the caller.
- `uniffi.spark_frost` is now imported only by three files —
  `Signer/SparkSigner.cs` (in-process default signer), `Signer/FrostAggregator.cs`
  (public-only aggregation wrapper), and `Services/SparkTxBuilder.cs`
  (public-only tx construction wrapper). Every service file is uniffi-free.
- Architecture invariants enforced by file layout — a single `grep -rl "using uniffi"`
  catches any regression in PR review.

### Tests
- 124 unit tests pass. 46 standard integration tests pass.
- All three new encrypted-batch APIs verified end-to-end on mainnet via the
  `[Explicit]` integration suite:
  `BuildEncryptedSendTweaksAsync` (Transfer, Lightning send, Swap, delegated
  Lightning, external Lightning address), `BuildEncryptedClaimTweaksAsync`
  (Swap return, transfer-to-third-wallet claim), and
  `BuildEncryptedPreimageSharesAsync` (Lightning invoice creation).

## [0.1.0-alpha.7] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- Unified `CurrencyAmount → sats` conversion across all three SSP fee
  call sites. `WithdrawalService.GetFeeQuoteAsync` already honoured the
  `original_unit` discriminator (alpha.6), but
  `LightningService.GetLightningSendFeeEstimateAsync` had a hard-coded
  `(millisats + 999) / 1000` (the GraphQL query didn't even request
  `original_unit`) and `GetLightningSendStatusAsync` only handled
  `MILLISATOSHI` explicitly, defaulting other units to sats-as-sats.
  Both would have under-quoted by 1000× if the SSP ever switched these
  fields to `SATOSHI` — exactly the same latent bug alpha.6 fixed on
  the withdrawal side. Both now route through
  `NSpark.GraphQL.CurrencyAmountExtensions.ToSats(value, unit)` with
  full unit support (SATOSHI, MILLISATOSHI, BITCOIN, MILLIBITCOIN,
  MICROBITCOIN, NANOBITCOIN).
- `Queries.LightningSendFeeEstimate` GraphQL now requests
  `original_unit` alongside `original_value` so the discriminator is
  observable.

### Changed
- `WithdrawalService.GetFeeQuoteAsync` no longer has its own inline
  `ToSats` switch — uses the shared helper.

### Tests
- `ShouldGetWithdrawalFeeEstimate` now asserts `fee > 100 sats` (was
  `> 0`). The alpha.5 silent regression returned 2 sats and passed the
  old assertion; the tightened threshold catches any future unit
  mishandling.

## [0.1.0-alpha.6] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- `LightningAddressService.ResolveLightningAddressAsync(wallet, lightningAddress, amountSats, ct)`
  — resolves a `user@domain` Lightning address to a concrete BOLT11
  invoice via LNURL-pay without paying it. Lets callers display a fee
  estimate (pair with `GetLightningSendFeeEstimateAsync`) or otherwise
  inspect the invoice before confirming. `PayLightningAddressAsync`
  now delegates to it.

### Fixed
- `WithdrawalService.GetFeeQuoteAsync` was hard-coded to assume SSP fees
  came back in millisats and divided by 1000 — that under-reported every
  fee returned in `SATOSHI` by a factor of 1000 (a 1606-sat fee was
  surfacing as 2 sats). The conversion now switches on the
  `CurrencyAmount.original_unit` discriminator and handles all
  Lightspark `CurrencyUnit` values (`SATOSHI`, `MILLISATOSHI`,
  `BITCOIN`, `MILLIBITCOIN`, `MICROBITCOIN`, `NANOBITCOIN`), rounding
  sub-sat units UP so the quote never under-quotes the SSP's required
  fee. Mirrors Lightspark's reference `amount_as_msats`.

## [0.1.0-alpha.5] - 2026-05-18

### Changed (breaking — unshipped API)
- `LightningService.GetLightningSendStatusAsync` now takes the SSP
  **request id** (the string returned from `PayLightningInvoiceAsync`)
  instead of the BOLT11 payment hash. The underlying GraphQL endpoint
  (`spark_lightning_payment`) was removed; status now flows through
  the polymorphic `user_request` query alongside Lightning receives.
  Only present on unshipped public API, so no SemVer-stable consumer
  is affected.
- The returned `LightningSendStatus.PaymentHash` is now an empty
  string — the new GraphQL projection on `LightningSendRequest` does
  not expose `payment_hash`. Callers that need the hash must keep
  their own `requestId ↔ paymentHash` mapping (it's available on the
  invoice you paid).
- Known `LightningSendRequestStatus` values are now documented on the
  method (`CREATED`, `REQUEST_VALIDATED`, `LIGHTNING_PAYMENT_INITIATED`,
  `LIGHTNING_PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED`/`FAILED`, `PREIMAGE_PROVIDED`/`PROVIDING_FAILED`,
  `TRANSFER_COMPLETED`/`FAILED`, `USER_TRANSFER_VALIDATION_FAILED`,
  `USER_SWAP_RETURNED`/`RETURN_FAILED`). Treat unknown values as still
  in flight — Spark reserves the right to add new ones.

### Fixed
- `GetLightningReceiveRequestStatusAsync` no longer returns a stray
  status string when the caller mistakenly passes a `LightningSendRequest`
  id (and vice-versa for `GetLightningSendStatusAsync`). Each method now
  verifies the polymorphic `__typename` and returns `null` for the wrong
  type rather than misinterpreting the payload.
- Fee millisatoshi→satoshi conversion: `LightningSendRequest.fee` is
  delivered in millisats; `GetLightningSendStatusAsync` now rounds up
  to whole sats, matching `GetLightningSendFeeEstimateAsync`.

### Added
- Integration test
  `LightningTests.GetLightningSendStatus_should_track_a_send_to_terminal`
  asserts:
  1. Unknown request ids return `null`.
  2. Receive-request ids return `null` (type-guard).
  3. A real A→B send transitions through known statuses to a terminal
     value within a 1-minute window.

## [0.1.0-alpha.4] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- SSP-rejected refund-tx construction in five hot paths. The SSP validates
  every refund tx and rejects with `"expected value X on output 0"` when
  the refund output value isn't decremented by the standard Bitcoin-network
  fee (191 vbytes × 5 sat/vbyte = 955 sats). The previous code was passing
  `feeSats: 0` in:
  - `ClaimService.ClaimSingleTransferAsync` (incoming-transfer claim refund)
  - `LightningService.PayLightningInvoiceAsync` (v3 preimage-swap refund)
  - `SwapService.ProcessSwapBatchAsync` (swap-output refund)
  - `TransferService.SendAsync` (sender-side refund)
  - `WithdrawalService.WithdrawAsync` (cooperative-exit refund)

  All now use the single `SparkConstants.DefaultRefundFeeSats` constant.
  Verified end-to-end against the live SSP: Lightning send debits exactly
  `invoiceAmount + SSP routing fee` (no 955-sat surcharge to the user
  balance — the 955 is the on-chain miner fee that would only apply in a
  unilateral exit broadcast).

### Changed
- `DepositService.DefaultFeeSats` (and the equivalent local constant in
  `LightningService`) now point at `SparkConstants.DefaultRefundFeeSats`
  so all flows reference one source of truth.

### Added
- `NSpark.Services.SparkConstants` (internal) — centralizes the
  `DefaultRefundFeeSats = 191 × 5 = 955` constant. Internal-only, no
  public-API surface change.

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- `LightningService.GetLightningSendStatusAsync(SparkWallet, string, CancellationToken)`
  extension method — query the SSP for the status of an outgoing Lightning
  payment by its BOLT11 payment hash. Returns `null` when the SSP has no
  record, an in-flight `LightningSendStatus` (no fee / no preimage) while the
  HTLC is pending, and the final status with `FeeSats` + `Preimage` populated
  once the payment flips to `SUCCEEDED`.
- `NSpark.Models.LightningSendStatus` record carrying `PaymentHash`, `Status`,
  `FeeSats`, and `Preimage`.

### Fixed
- CS1573 doc-comment warning on `GetLightningSendStatusAsync`: the lone
  `<param>` tag triggered the "missing param tag" rule for the other
  parameters. Folded the `paymentHash` description into the `<summary>` to
  match the convention used by sibling extension methods in
  `LightningService`.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Full reference documentation under `docs/`:
  - `architecture.md` — layering, lifetimes, transport, observability,
    the two-claim model, trust assumptions.
  - `lightning/receiving-invoices.md` — full receive flow with the
    `ClaimPendingTransfersAsync` step called out as required.
  - `lightning/paying-invoices.md` — BOLT11 + Lightning Address paths,
    fee estimation, failure modes, idempotency.
  - `lightning/description-hash.md` — NIP-57 zap-receiver pattern
    with the two-claim flow honored.
  - `signer.md` — `ISparkSigner` contract, when to write a custom one
    (HSM / KMS / hardware), per-member implementation guide.
  - `deposits.md` — single-use and static deposit flows, including the
    two-claim sequence for static deposits
    (`ClaimStaticDepositAsync` then `ClaimPendingTransfersAsync`).
  - `withdrawals.md` — cooperative-exit flow, fee quote, idempotency
    notes.
  - `configuration.md` — every `SparkOptions` field documented.
  - `faq.md`, `glossary.md`.
- Suppressed `CA1873` repository-wide (joins `CA1848` — neither rule
  fits NSpark's pattern of one-shot lifecycle logs with trivial
  property-access arguments). Fixes the CI build on the latest
  NetAnalyzers shipped on GitHub's Windows/macOS runners.

### Fixed
- Documentation URLs throughout the codebase now point at the public
  repository `github.com/p-i-g-g-y/nspark` (no remaining references to
  the pre-public path).

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Multi-targeting: `net8.0;net9.0;net10.0`.
- Central package management (`Directory.Packages.props`) and shared build
  infrastructure (`Directory.Build.props`, `.editorconfig`, `global.json`).
- Custom exception hierarchy rooted at `SparkException` with retryability
  classification (`SparkConnectionException.FromRpc`, `InvalidBolt11Exception`,
  `InsufficientFundsException`, `PaymentFailedException`,
  `InvoiceExpiredException`, etc.).
- Structured logging via `ILogger<T>` with documented `EventId`s in
  `NSpark.Diagnostics.LogEvents`.
- Sensitive-data redaction via `NSpark.Diagnostics.Sensitive<T>`.
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation: `ActivitySource("NSpark")` and
  `Meter("NSpark")` (`NSpark.Diagnostics.SparkActivitySource`,
  `NSpark.Diagnostics.SparkMeter`).
- Polly v8 resilience pipeline scaffolding
  (`NSpark.Connection.SparkResiliencePolicies`).
- Hosted-service hook for ASP.NET Core / generic host integrations
  (`NSpark.Hosting.SparkHostedService`).
- `IAsyncDisposable` on `SparkConnection`.

### Changed
- Renamed package, assembly, and namespace from `Spark.Client` to **`NSpark`**.
- Renamed `SparkClient` → `SparkConnection`,
  `SparkClientOptions` → `SparkOptions`,
  `AddSparkClient(...)` → `AddSpark(...)`.
- Auth token cache is now per-instance, TTL-evicted with an LRU size cap
  (default 1024 entries) — previously process-global and unbounded.
- gRPC-generated protobuf types are emitted as `internal`; transport-layer
  classes (`GrpcConnectionPool`, `SparkAuthenticator`, `ServerTimeSync`,
  `SspGraphQLClient`) demoted to `internal`. Public surface is now limited
  to `SparkConnection`, `SparkWallet`, `SparkOptions`, `ISparkSigner`,
  models, exceptions, diagnostics, hosting, and resilience helpers.

### Security
- `KeyDerivation.ComputePreimage` zeroes the local HTLC private-key buffer
  with `CryptographicOperations.ZeroMemory` after computing the preimage.
- See [docs/trust-model.md](docs/trust-model.md) for the documented threat
  model and the default Signing Operator / SSP trust assumptions.
