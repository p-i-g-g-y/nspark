# Security Policy

NSpark is a Bitcoin / Lightning payments SDK. Bugs in NSpark may directly
move funds. We treat security reports as our highest-priority work.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not file public GitHub issues for security bugs.**

Use either:

- GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/p-i-g-g-y/nspark/security/advisories/new)
  feature on this repository (preferred — gives us a private workspace,
  CVE issuance, and audit trail).
- Email **gm@orklabs.com** with `[NSpark Security]` in the subject.

We will:

1. Acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**.
2. Confirm or reject the report (with reasoning) within **7 days**.
3. Coordinate a fix and a disclosure timeline — typically **90 days**
   from confirmation, shorter if the bug is being exploited, longer if a
   dependency or downstream ecosystem coordination is required.
4. Credit you in the advisory unless you prefer anonymity.

## Severity rubric

| Severity | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Remote theft of funds, key extraction, signature forgery, FROST round manipulation |
| **High**     | Bypass of payment authorization, denial of service on receiver, ECIES decryption oracle |
| **Medium**   | Insufficient validation that the user can defend against, memory leaks that survive Dispose, log lines that leak sensitive material |
| **Low**      | Hardening opportunities, missing checks where exploitation would also require a higher-severity bug |

## Scope

In scope:

- The `NSpark` NuGet package (assembly, dependencies, packaged native libs)
- This repository's CI/CD pipelines and release tooling
- The `spark_frost` native binary as shipped by this repository

Out of scope:

- The Spark protocol itself (report to <https://www.spark.money/security> or
  the relevant operator)
- The Signing Operators run by third parties
- Lightning Service Provider (SSP) implementations
- Vulnerabilities in upstream Rust crates that compose `spark_frost` —
  report to the affected crate's RustSec advisory first; we will mirror

## Trust boundary

NSpark assumes:

- The **host process** is trusted (i.e. NSpark does not defend against an
  attacker with code execution in the calling process — see
  [`docs/trust-model.md`](docs/trust-model.md)).
- The **configured Signing Operators** are honest-but-curious. NSpark
  protects against a minority of operators going rogue via FROST threshold
  signing; key extraction by a colluding majority is out of scope.
- The **configured SSP** is honest-but-curious. Description hashes are
  validated; routing-fee griefing is mitigated by `MaxFeeSats` enforcement.
- The **host's clock** is within reasonable tolerance of the network's clock
  (see `ServerTimeSync`).

These assumptions are restated in detail in
[`docs/trust-model.md`](docs/trust-model.md). Any report that does not
respect this boundary will be acknowledged but is unlikely to result in a
code change.

## Supply chain

Every NSpark release ships:

- A SHA-256 manifest of all native binaries at
  `runtimes/SHA256SUMS.txt` inside the NuGet, also published on the GitHub
  Release page.
- An [SLSA build provenance attestation](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/) via
  `actions/attest-build-provenance`. Verify with:

  ```bash
  gh attestation verify NSpark.<version>.nupkg --owner p-i-g-g-y
  ```

- A CycloneDX SBOM as a release asset.

Reports on supply-chain issues (compromised dependencies, dependency
confusion, malicious package suggestions) are explicitly in scope.
